-_-_-_-_-_ ALL CONTENT IS CURRENTLY UNDER REVISION _-_-_-_-_-

## Class Description

This course is intended for humanities-based researchers who do not have a programming
background, but would like to understand how programs work "behind
the scenes." Over the
week, the emphasis will be on understanding how computer programmers think so
that participants will be able to participate in high-level
conceptual discussions with more confidence. These general
concepts will be reinforced and illustrated with hands-on development of
simple programs that can be used to assist with text-based research and analysis.

The programming language used for most of the course will be Python. Python has an easy-to-learn and 
gentle syntax, and powerful extensions. Use of the command-line interface
and regular expressions will also be demonstrated and emphasized. 

## Day 1: Shell (4.5hr)

We will spend the day working with the terminal, learning the basics of the
file system, data flow programming, and text manipulation. The goal is to get
comfortable with the conversational, call and response style of programming.

Light lecture in the morning that builds on experiences the day before,
focusing on the mindset of a programmer and important high-level programming
concepts. Following this will be a small set of activities using python solely
in the terminal to give a sense of how these concepts are implemented
generally.  The second part of the morning will include a live coding demo
using python in the terminal and a text editor in a separate window to show
how to build an simple tool that will report the corresponding symbol of the
Chinese Zodiac for a given input year that participants will be able to follow
along with.  See the zodiac folder for these steps.  This provides two
essential things:

1. observation of an actual coding process
2. a generic template demonstrating the core features of many programs that can be drawn on for the rest of the course and into the future.

## Day 3: Python II (6hr)

- 2.2 Coding with John: [Zodiac](https://github.com/xpmethod-workshops/dhsi-coding-fundamentals/tree/master/python-live-code/zodiac).  We will be using the shell and a text editor for this session.  If you are using windows then it will make sense to use the command prompt rather than MobaXterm because it will give you easier access to the Anaconda installs of Python.  You can use many of your Bash Shell commands in the Windows Command Prompt but you'll find a crash course [HERE](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr05/cos126/cmd-prompt.html).

- 2.3 Code Review:
[RikersBot](https://github.com/xpmethod/rikersbot/blob/master/rikersbot.py)

- 2.4 Code Annotation/Templates.  [Version with small data files]() (98.7MB, GitHub). [Version with full data files](https://owncloud.westgrid.ca/index.php/s/V3OkC0uCbTU20Oh) (2.4GB, Compute Canada's OwnCloud)

- 3.1 Lab: Essay Grader Handout

- 3.2 Thinking Like a Programmer: From Comments to Code

- 3.3 Project brainstorm and initial planning

We will complete any remaining steps from the Zodiac tool demo and then move
to an activity where the participants are given working code examples and
asked to add comments to these.  This exercise will help participants
understand the structure of programs better while underscoring the importance
of commenting code in the first place.

Today we will also move from a command line + text editor environment for
programming to the Jupyter Notebook environment that is provided within the
Anaconda install.

In the afternoon participants will begin planning their project for Day four
and five.

## Day 4: Individual Projects (6hr)

The bulk of today will be spent by participants in teams developing the
projects that they began planning the day before. Participants will also be
introduced to an *Integrated Development Environment (IDE)*, so there will be
three options for how to develop a program:

1. Command line + text editor
2. Jupyter notebooks
3. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (a Python specific IDE)

There is no wrong answer here. Try to choose tools that are 
[FOSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), universal, and
extensible.

- 1hr write a short 1-2 paragraph description of your project. Concentrate on
the goals of the *what* you are trying to accomplish, not the technical
details. Spend some time discussing what tools and datasets you would need for
the project. For example a simple project description may be:

> Using Python NLTK, our group would like to build an "essay grader" which
> would take as its input a sample essay and output a score, based on several
> parameters like sentence length variation and richness of vocabulary.

- 1hr translate or "formalize" your goals into a series of step by step
instructions in pseudocode.

- project work for the rest of the day

## Day 5: Race to Finish (3h)

**9:30 - 11:30am**

Reevaluate the scope of your project. Cut out inessential functionality. We are 
trying to get to a "minimally viable" prototype stage. Take notes via code comments 
throughout.

**11:3 - noon**

Concluding remarks. Showcase and Plenary meeting after.

## Project Code Share

Projects will go here.
